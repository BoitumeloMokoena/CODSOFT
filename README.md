# Small Projects - CODSOFT 💻

Welcome to my CODSOFT repository! Here, I've completed various tasks as part of my CODSOFT assignments.

## Completed Projects 🚀
- **Numbers Game**: A simple game where you guess a number between a specified range. It generates a random number and prompts the user to guess it. Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Student Grade Calculator**: A program to calculate the grades of students based on their scores. It takes input of scores and calculates the grades according to a predefined grading system.
- **ATM Interface**: A basic Java program simulating an ATM interface. It allows users to perform basic ATM operations like checking balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money.

## About CODSOFT 📚
CODSOFT was a rewarding experience where I had the opportunity to learn and apply various programming concepts. Through completing these projects, I enhanced my skills in Java programming and problem-solving.

## Basic Runs 🏃‍♂️
- **Numbers Game**: To run the Numbers Game, compile and execute the corresponding Java file (`NumbersGame.java`).
- **Student Grade Calculator**: Compile and execute the Java file (`StudentGradeCalculator.java`) for the Student Grade Calculator to use it.
- **ATM Interface**: Run the ATM Interface Java program (`ATMInterface.java`) to access its functionalities.

Feel free to explore the code and make any improvements or suggestions!
